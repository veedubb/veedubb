<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª Software Development Projects:</h2>

- <b>Cloud-Based Trading Strategies for Individual Investors (NDA)</b>
  - Developed an MVC Cloud-Based Web Application for an Industry Partner
  - Application leverages technically interpreted algorithms to determine trading strategies for given ticker(s) based on its historical data and current trends.
