## Hi there 👋
<h1>Hi, I'm Tyrell! <br/>

<h2>👨‍💻 Software Development Projects:</h2>

- <b>Cloud-Based Trading Strategies for Individual Investors (NDA)</b>
  - Developed an MVC Cloud-Based Web Application for an Industry Partner
  - Application leverages technically interpreted algorithms to determine trading strategies for given ticker(s) based on its historical data and current trends.
  - Technologies:
    - Python (backend)
    - Flask
    - MySQL
    - MongoDB
    - React
  - Worked with Industry Partner to further develop a web application designed to find optimal solutions to trading strategies.
  - Primarily focused on backend of the web application:
    - Existing monolith had to be broken apart into models, views, and controllers.
    - Worked extensively with PyMoo (multi-objective search), Flask (route creation), yFinance (historical trading data), and backtesting.py (historical stock testing) libraries.
  - Worked closely with development through the entire SDLC from Planning to Deployment.
  - Leveraged Agile methodology, allowing for flexibility and sponsor collaboration.
