  This project required me to sign an NDA, so I am unable to share the repository. However, I can speak to higher level details about the project.

<h2>Technologies Used:</h2>

 <h2>Notable Achievement and Roadblocks</h2>
 
- <b>Validation of Backtesting Results</b>
  - Team was tasked with validating results of backtesting.py with those our industry sponsor was able to get from another library.
    - Motivation: backtesting.py offered performance improvements over the tool previously used.
    - Challenges:
      - The team had access to results, but not the source code of the existing backtester.
    - Result:
      - We were able to get reliable results that were consistently within an acceptable margin of the results our sponsor was producing.
      - This was mainly due to the correction of warm-up period problems that were occurring as we neared the edge of historical data that yfinance offers.
